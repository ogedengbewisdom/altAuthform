                My name is <strong>Ogedengbe Wisdom</strong>, I have always been drawn to technology with passion of becoming
                a world-class Software Engineer, my mind being molded to solve real world problems to make the world a better place
                for my community, state, country and the entire universe. To achieve my dream I walk the talk of which i applied to join <strong><i>AltSchool Africa</i></strong> 
                to shape my technincal and non-technical skills to the best industry standard, which is moving smoothly and well, I was given admission in
                School of Engineering in which am going for the frontend track and here is my student ID number: <strong>ALT/SOE/023/2784.</strong>.

            <p>
                After graduating from the university i said to myself this is a time of exploration. started learning how to code on freeCodeCamp and scrimba, 
                where i learn the basics of programming and build  mini-projects. 
                These early experiences are like kindling to a fire, and my determination to become a world-class software engineer grows stronger.
                I was still not satisfied because i always felt there's alot to learn and explore that's why i joined <strong><i>AltSchool Africa</i></strong>.
                to be confidence in my technincal skills and networking with my mates.

                I know good and experience mentors will play a pivotal role in my journey,
                to seek guidance from experienced software engineers who generously share their knowledge and insights and have achieved 
                Milestones in their journey include developing software applications, 
                contributing to open-source projects, and learning from their failures so i won't make same mistake they made.
